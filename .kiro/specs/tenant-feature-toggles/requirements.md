# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Tenant Feature Toggles system provides space owners with granular control over platform features, allowing them to enable only what they need while avoiding interface complexity. This system supports progressive disclosure of advanced features, plan-based feature activation, and dependency management to ensure a clean, focused user experience tailored to each tenant's specific needs and subscription level.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Toggle-Based Feature Activation

**User Story:** As a space owner, I want toggle-based feature activation per tenant so that I can enable only the features I need and keep my interface clean and focused.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring features THEN the system SHALL provide toggle-based feature activation per tenant
2. WHEN a feature is disabled THEN the system SHALL hide all related UI elements and navigation items
3. WHEN a feature is enabled THEN the system SHALL make all related functionality immediately available
4. IF a feature has sub-features THEN the system SHALL allow granular control over individual sub-components
5. WHEN feature settings are changed THEN the system SHALL apply changes immediately without requiring system restart

### Requirement 2: Plan-Based Feature Management

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want automatic feature activation based on subscription plans so that tenants get appropriate feature sets when upgrading or downgrading plans.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN upgrading plans THEN the system SHALL automatically enable appropriate feature sets
2. WHEN downgrading plans THEN the system SHALL gracefully disable premium features with data preservation
3. WHEN plan changes occur THEN the system SHALL notify affected users about feature availability changes
4. IF plan limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL provide clear upgrade prompts and usage warnings
5. WHEN managing plan features THEN the system SHALL support custom feature bundles for enterprise clients

### Requirement 3: Feature Dependency Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want feature dependency enforcement so that required features are automatically enabled when dependent features are activated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF feature dependencies exist THEN the system SHALL enforce proper activation sequences
2. WHEN enabling a feature THEN the system SHALL automatically enable all required dependencies
3. WHEN disabling a feature THEN the system SHALL warn about dependent features that will be affected
4. IF circular dependencies exist THEN the system SHALL prevent invalid configuration states
5. WHEN dependency conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear resolution options

### Requirement 4: Progressive Feature Disclosure

**User Story:** As a space owner, I want progressive disclosure of advanced features so that I can start with basic functionality and gradually access more complex features as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing complexity THEN the system SHALL provide progressive disclosure of advanced features
2. WHEN users are new THEN the system SHALL show simplified interfaces with basic feature sets
3. WHEN users gain experience THEN the system SHALL offer to unlock additional feature categories
4. IF advanced features are needed THEN the system SHALL provide guided activation with explanations
5. WHEN feature complexity increases THEN the system SHALL maintain clear feature categorization

### Requirement 5: Industry-Specific Feature Sets

**User Story:** As a space owner in a specific industry, I want industry-appropriate feature recommendations so that I get relevant functionality without unnecessary complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting industry modules THEN the system SHALL recommend appropriate feature combinations
2. WHEN industry templates are applied THEN the system SHALL pre-configure relevant feature toggles
3. WHEN switching industries THEN the system SHALL migrate feature settings appropriately
4. IF industry-specific features exist THEN the system SHALL highlight them in the feature selection interface
5. WHEN onboarding new tenants THEN the system SHALL provide industry-specific feature setup wizards

### Requirement 6: Feature Usage Analytics

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want feature usage analytics so that I can understand which features are most valuable and optimize the platform accordingly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN features are used THEN the system SHALL track usage patterns and frequency
2. WHEN analyzing adoption THEN the system SHALL provide feature adoption rates across tenants
3. WHEN features are underutilized THEN the system SHALL identify opportunities for feature promotion or removal
4. IF usage patterns change THEN the system SHALL alert administrators to significant trends
5. WHEN optimizing features THEN the system SHALL provide data-driven recommendations for feature improvements

### Requirement 7: Feature Configuration Interface

**User Story:** As a space owner, I want an intuitive feature configuration interface so that I can easily manage my platform features without technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring features THEN the system SHALL provide a visual, categorized feature management interface
2. WHEN viewing features THEN the system SHALL show clear descriptions, benefits, and requirements for each feature
3. WHEN making changes THEN the system SHALL provide real-time preview of interface changes
4. IF configuration errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and resolution steps
5. WHEN saving configurations THEN the system SHALL validate settings and confirm successful application

### Requirement 8: Feature Access Control

**User Story:** As an account owner, I want role-based feature configuration access so that only authorized users can modify feature settings while others can view current configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing feature access THEN the system SHALL restrict feature configuration to authorized roles
2. WHEN users lack permissions THEN the system SHALL show read-only feature status information
3. WHEN permission changes occur THEN the system SHALL immediately update feature management access
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and deny access
5. WHEN delegating feature management THEN the system SHALL support granular permission assignment

### Requirement 9: Feature Migration and Data Handling

**User Story:** As a space owner, I want safe feature transitions so that when I disable features, my data is preserved and can be restored if I re-enable them later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN disabling features THEN the system SHALL preserve all associated data in a recoverable state
2. WHEN re-enabling features THEN the system SHALL restore previous configurations and data
3. WHEN data retention limits are reached THEN the system SHALL notify users before permanent deletion
4. IF feature data conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL provide conflict resolution options
5. WHEN migrating between feature versions THEN the system SHALL handle data schema changes automatically

### Requirement 10: Feature Performance Impact

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want feature toggle performance optimization so that disabled features don't impact system performance or load times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN features are disabled THEN the system SHALL not load related code, assets, or database queries
2. WHEN optimizing performance THEN the system SHALL lazy-load feature components only when enabled
3. WHEN measuring impact THEN the system SHALL provide performance metrics for feature-specific operations
4. IF performance degradation occurs THEN the system SHALL identify feature-related performance bottlenecks
5. WHEN scaling the system THEN the system SHALL optimize resource usage based on enabled feature sets
