# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on implementing comprehensive performance optimization across the Claude platform to ensure fast, responsive performance for all users regardless of tenant size or complexity. The optimization covers database performance, frontend responsiveness, caching strategies, and scalability requirements to maintain excellent user experience under varying load conditions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want database queries to execute quickly and efficiently so that I can access my data without delays, even as the platform scales.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying tenant data THEN the system SHALL return results in under 100ms for 95% of queries
2. WHEN multiple tenants access the system THEN the system SHALL maintain performance isolation between tenants
3. WHEN database grows beyond 100GB THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-second response times through proper indexing
4. IF slow queries are detected THEN the system SHALL log and alert administrators automatically
5. WHEN complex reporting queries run THEN the system SHALL use materialized views to prevent performance degradation

### Requirement 2: Frontend Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want the web interface to load quickly and respond immediately to my interactions so that I can work efficiently without waiting for pages to load or actions to complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading any page THEN the system SHALL achieve Core Web Vitals "Good" scores (LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1)
2. WHEN editing content THEN the system SHALL provide real-time updates without full page reloads
3. WHEN uploading media THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators and optimize files automatically
4. IF network conditions are poor THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade while maintaining functionality
5. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the system SHALL load in under 3 seconds on 3G connections

### Requirement 3: Caching and Edge Optimization

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want content to load instantly from locations near me so that I experience minimal latency regardless of my geographic location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is published THEN the system SHALL cache at edge locations globally for sub-100ms delivery
2. WHEN content is updated THEN the system SHALL invalidate relevant cache automatically within 30 seconds
3. WHEN serving static assets THEN the system SHALL leverage CDN with 99.9% cache hit rates
4. IF cache systems fail THEN the system SHALL fallback to origin servers without user-visible errors
5. WHEN API responses are cacheable THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent cache strategies per endpoint

### Requirement 4: Scalability and Load Management

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want the system to automatically handle increased load and scale resources so that performance remains consistent during peak usage periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN concurrent users exceed 1000 THEN the system SHALL auto-scale without performance degradation
2. WHEN tenant data grows THEN the system SHALL partition effectively to maintain query performance
3. WHEN peak traffic occurs THEN the system SHALL handle 10x normal load through horizontal scaling
4. IF resource constraints occur THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical operations over nice-to-have features
5. WHEN global users access the system THEN the system SHALL route to nearest edge locations automatically
