## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation Strategy

- **Prototype critical integrations early** - Test tenant isolation and industry module integration before full implementation
- **Validate tenant isolation at each step** - Ensure no cross-tenant data leakage throughout development
- **Test with realistic multi-tenant data** - Use representative data volumes and tenant counts for testing
- **Performance test incrementally** - Monitor performance impact of each major feature addition
- **Document tenant-specific configurations** - Maintain clear documentation for industry-specific customizations
