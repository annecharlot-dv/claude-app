# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes a comprehensive, hierarchical data structure that supports unlimited industry configurations and use cases. The system will provide flexible location hierarchies, robust multi-tenant data isolation, adaptable user management, versatile resource booking, industry-specific customization, comprehensive financial data architecture, and dynamic communication/content management. This foundational architecture will enable the platform to handle any type of space configuration from simple rooms to complex multi-building campuses across all supported industries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Hierarchical Location Structure

**User Story:** As a platform architect, I want unlimited hierarchy levels for location organization so that any space configuration can be accurately represented and managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining locations THEN the system SHALL support unlimited hierarchy levels: Country → State/Province → City → Address → Building → Floor → Room → Sub-space → Desk
2. WHEN configuring spaces THEN the system SHALL allow custom naming at each level (Building/Wing/Campus, Floor/Level, Room/Studio/Suite, Desk/Workstation/Booth)
3. WHEN managing locations THEN the system SHALL support flexible relationships where rooms can exist without floors and desks without rooms
4. IF location hierarchy changes THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and update all related bookings/resources
5. WHEN displaying locations THEN the system SHALL provide industry-appropriate terminology per tenant

### Requirement 2: Multi-Tenant Data Isolation

**User Story:** As a platform architect, I want complete data isolation between tenants so that each organization's data remains secure and separate while maintaining system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing any data THEN the system SHALL include tenant_id with proper indexing and row-level security
2. WHEN querying data THEN the system SHALL automatically filter by tenant context without manual intervention
3. WHEN creating relationships THEN the system SHALL prevent cross-tenant data references
4. IF tenant deletion occurs THEN the system SHALL cascade delete all related data while preserving audit trails
5. WHEN backing up data THEN the system SHALL support tenant-specific data export and import

### Requirement 3: Flexible User Management

**User Story:** As a platform architect, I want hierarchical user roles with industry-specific terminology so that any organization structure can be properly represented and managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing users THEN the system SHALL support hierarchical roles: Platform Admin → Tenant Owner → Property Manager → Department Manager → Staff → Member
2. WHEN assigning permissions THEN the system SHALL support granular access control at resource and feature levels
3. WHEN handling corporate clients THEN the system SHALL support Company → Teams/Departments → Individual Users with inherited permissions
4. IF user roles change THEN the system SHALL immediately update access across all platform features
5. WHEN supporting industries THEN the system SHALL adapt role terminology (Manager/Custodian vs Concierge/Housekeeping vs Administrator/Security)

### Requirement 4: Resource & Booking Data Structure

**User Story:** As a platform architect, I want flexible resource definitions and booking capabilities so that any type of bookable item can be managed with complex scheduling and pricing rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining bookable resources THEN the system SHALL support any granularity: buildings, floors, rooms, desks, equipment, services
2. WHEN managing availability THEN the system SHALL support complex scheduling: business hours, exceptions, maintenance windows, seasonal changes
3. WHEN handling pricing THEN the system SHALL support multi-dimensional pricing: resource type, time of day, member tier, duration, group size
4. IF booking conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide conflict resolution with alternative suggestions
5. WHEN tracking usage THEN the system SHALL maintain detailed analytics: utilization rates, revenue per resource, member behavior patterns

### Requirement 5: Industry-Specific Data Customization

**User Story:** As a platform architect, I want industry-specific data customization capabilities so that each industry's unique requirements and terminology can be properly supported.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring for different industries THEN the system SHALL support custom fields and attributes per resource type
2. WHEN adapting terminology THEN the system SHALL dynamically rename fields and labels based on industry module
3. WHEN managing compliance THEN the system SHALL support industry-specific data requirements (government security clearances, hotel guest information)
4. IF regulations change THEN the system SHALL support schema evolution without data migration
5. WHEN reporting data THEN the system SHALL provide industry-appropriate metrics and KPIs

### Requirement 6: Financial Data Architecture

**User Story:** As a platform architect, I want comprehensive financial data handling so that complex billing scenarios and multi-party transactions can be properly managed and tracked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling transactions THEN the system SHALL support multi-currency, multi-payment-method, multi-party transactions
2. WHEN managing subscriptions THEN the system SHALL support complex billing: prorations, credits, refunds, usage-based charges
3. WHEN tracking revenue THEN the system SHALL support revenue recognition across different business models
4. IF payment failures occur THEN the system SHALL maintain transaction integrity with proper rollback mechanisms
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide real-time financial data with audit trails

### Requirement 7: Communication & Content Data

**User Story:** As a platform architect, I want flexible communication and content management so that all touchpoints and content can be tracked, versioned, and personalized across different channels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing content THEN the system SHALL support versioning, scheduling, and multi-language content
2. WHEN handling communications THEN the system SHALL track all touchpoints: emails, SMS, in-app notifications, calls
3. WHEN managing workflows THEN the system SHALL support complex automation with conditional logic and branching
4. IF data privacy requests occur THEN the system SHALL support right-to-be-forgotten with complete data removal
5. WHEN personalizing content THEN the system SHALL support dynamic content based on user attributes and behavior
