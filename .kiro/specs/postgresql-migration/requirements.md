# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a complete migration from MongoDB to PostgreSQL as the single database solution for the Claude Space-as-a-Service platform. The migration will eliminate all MongoDB dependencies while leveraging PostgreSQL's relational power, JSON capabilities, and official Payload CMS support. This architectural change will provide better data consistency, improved query capabilities, and simplified infrastructure management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to migrate all data storage from MongoDB to PostgreSQL, so that the platform uses a single, more powerful database solution with better relational capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing database architecture THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL exclusively for all data storage needs
2. WHEN removing MongoDB dependencies THEN the system SHALL eliminate all MongoDB packages, configurations, and references from the entire codebase
3. WHEN configuring database connections THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL connection strings exclusively
4. IF existing MongoDB data exists THEN the system SHALL provide migration scripts to transfer all data to PostgreSQL
5. WHEN designing database schema THEN the system SHALL leverage PostgreSQL's JSON/JSONB capabilities for flexible document-style storage where needed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want to integrate FastAPI with PostgreSQL using modern async patterns, so that the application maintains high performance while using relational database capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing FastAPI backend THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL-compatible ORM (SQLAlchemy with asyncpg driver)
2. WHEN configuring database connections THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling optimized for PostgreSQL
3. WHEN implementing multi-tenant architecture THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL row-level security (RLS) for tenant isolation
4. IF document-style data is needed THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL JSONB fields instead of MongoDB documents
5. WHEN implementing real-time features THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL NOTIFY/LISTEN or connection pooling strategies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want Payload CMS to work seamlessly with PostgreSQL, so that I can manage content using the official PostgreSQL adapter with full feature support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up Payload CMS THEN the system SHALL install and configure @payloadcms/db-postgres adapter
2. WHEN configuring Payload database connection THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL connection string with proper SSL configuration
3. WHEN designing CMS collections THEN the system SHALL leverage PostgreSQL relational capabilities for complex relationships
4. IF flexible schema is needed THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL JSON fields within Payload collections
5. WHEN implementing search THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL full-text search capabilities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to optimize the database architecture for PostgreSQL, so that the platform achieves maximum performance and scalability with proper multi-tenant isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing multi-tenant schema THEN the system SHALL implement tenant isolation using PostgreSQL schemas or RLS policies
2. WHEN implementing caching THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL-compatible caching strategies (Redis + PostgreSQL)
3. WHEN handling large datasets THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL partitioning and indexing strategies
4. IF analytics are needed THEN the system SHALL leverage PostgreSQL's analytical capabilities and materialized views
5. WHEN implementing backup strategies THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL-native backup and recovery tools

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want all technology stack documentation and code to reflect the PostgreSQL-only architecture, so that developers have accurate guidance and examples.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting architecture THEN the system SHALL reflect PostgreSQL-only database strategy in all documentation
2. WHEN updating all documentation THEN the system SHALL remove every MongoDB reference and replace with PostgreSQL equivalents
3. WHEN providing code examples THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL syntax, connection strings, and query patterns
4. IF performance comparisons are made THEN the system SHALL focus on PostgreSQL optimization techniques
5. WHEN planning deployment THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL-compatible hosting and scaling strategies

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a comprehensive migration plan with step-by-step procedures, so that I can safely migrate existing data and update all dependencies without service interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating from existing setup THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step PostgreSQL migration procedures
2. WHEN updating dependencies THEN the system SHALL replace all MongoDB packages with PostgreSQL equivalents
3. WHEN updating configuration files THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL connection strings exclusively
4. IF data migration is required THEN the system SHALL provide scripts to convert MongoDB data to PostgreSQL format
5. WHEN testing implementation THEN the system SHALL verify all functionality works with PostgreSQL backend
