The previous AI engineer initially misconstrued the project scope, believing it to be a simple coworking platform. Upon receiving the comprehensive Product Requirements Specification (PRS) in Chat Message 104, the engineer successfully pivoted, acknowledging the need to build a holistic Space Management Platform. The core architectural decision, guided by user input (Chat Message 5 & 8), was to implement a Core-Module Architecture, likening the Core to an operating system with agnostic kernels (Identity, Booking, Financial, CMS, Communication) and Modules as industry-specific applications (e.g., Coworking, Hotel).

Significant progress was made in implementing this architecture on the backend, with all kernels and initial modules (Coworking, Government, Hotel, University, Creative Studio, Residential) established, and  refactored. Frontend integration followed, focusing on a module-aware UI, which involved updating , , , and  components. This led to a fully functional module-driven UI, dynamically transforming the user experience based on the selected tenant module.

The latest work focuses on implementing the Enhanced Tenant CMS System, specifically for the Coworking module, as detailed in the user's Balanced CMS Customization requirements. The engineer created backend CMS engine logic, a frontend page builder component, and corresponding API endpoints. The immediate task at the end of the trajectory was debugging an issue where these new CMS API endpoints were not accessible due to incorrect placement within , which the engineer was actively rectifying.

<product_requirements>
The overarching goal is to develop Claude, a multi-tenant space management platform designed to replace disparate SaaS tools with a unified native solution. It targets diverse industries (coworking, hotels, government, universities, etc.) via industry-specific modules. Key architectural requirements include multi-tenancy with isolated environments, custom subdomains, and hierarchical user/location models. Core features encompass Member Management, Booking & Resource, Financial, Website & Content Management (CMS), Communication, and Community features, with future plans for AI, Analytics, and Integrations. The platform emphasizes a modern UI, competitive pricing, and a native-first approach with optional third-party integrations.

The platform employs a Core-Module Architecture, where the Core Platform (OS) provides universal Kernels (Identity, Resource & Booking, Financial, Content & CMS, Automation & Communication), and Modules (Applications) act as industry-specific experience transformation layers. Modules dynamically configure terminology, activate features, and adapt UI/UX. A two-tier marketplace model is envisioned: a main SaaS-level marketplace aggregating tenant resources, alongside tenant-controlled, branded websites with direct booking. The revenue model includes native Stripe integration with platform transaction fees, plus an option for enterprise tenants to use their own payment processors. The Enhanced Tenant CMS System requires a template-based foundation, structured content blocks, a controlled widget system, simplified design options, streamlined content management, and smart defaults for professional results.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database.
-   **Multi-tenancy**: Isolated environments per tenant.
-   **Authentication**: JWT-based for secure API access.
-   **Core-Module Architecture**: Universal Kernels (Identity, Booking, Financial, CMS, Communication) orchestrated by industry-specific Modules (e.g., Coworking, Hotel).
-   **Environment Variables**: Strict usage for , , .
-   **Service Management**: Supervisor for backend (port 8001) and frontend (port 3000) services.
-   **API Design**: Backend API routes must be prefixed with .
-   **Frontend State Management**: React Context (AuthContext, TenantContext) for global state and module loading.
-   **UI Transformation**: Dynamic UI/UX adaptation based on active module.
-   **Frontend Libraries**: , , .

The application utilizes a standard full-stack structure with distinct backend and frontend components.



-   : The core FastAPI application. This file has been extensively rewritten to integrate the new  and its kernel-module architecture. It now dynamically loads API routes and logic based on active modules. Frequent modifications involved ensuring new API endpoints were correctly registered before the  call.
-   : A new directory containing Python files for each universal kernel. These files define core, agnostic business logic (e.g.,  for authentication,  for scheduling).
-   : A new directory housing Python files for specific industry modules (e.g., , , ). These define how the core kernels are configured and presented for a given tenant type.  manages their registration.
-   : This central file orchestrates the interaction between kernels and modules, acting as the operating system for the platform.
-   : Contains backend logic for managing content blocks specific to the coworking module's CMS.
-   : Updated to seed demo data for all newly implemented industry modules, including tenant, user, and initial configuration data.
-   : Manages application-wide routing using . It now includes routes for the new module-aware pages.
-   : Provides the overall application layout, including navigation. It was modified to dynamically render navigation and branding based on the active module loaded via .
-   : Manages user authentication state. Modified to explicitly expose  for use by other contexts.
-   : A crucial new context responsible for fetching and providing tenant-specific module configurations to the frontend. It relies on  to determine when to load module data.
-   : Updated to display module-specific metrics and terminology, transforming its content based on the active tenant's module.
-   : This page now integrates the  component, serving as the entry point for tenant CMS management.
-   : A new React component designed to provide a visual interface for building pages using content blocks, specifically for the coworking module.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on integrating the newly developed Enhanced Tenant CMS System into the existing architecture, specifically for the Coworking module.

On the backend, a new file  was created to encapsulate the CMS logic for content blocks. Corresponding API endpoints to support this CMS system were added to . Additionally, the backend  directory was properly initialized.

On the frontend, the visual page builder component, , was created. The main CMS page, , was modified to integrate this new page builder, enabling tenants to manage their website content. The  was updated to include  and  for drag-and-drop functionality in the page builder.

The immediate problem encountered and being addressed was a critical routing issue: the newly added Enhanced CMS API endpoints in  were not being properly exposed. The AI identified that these endpoints were mistakenly placed *after* the  statement, preventing them from being registered. The last action taken was to move these endpoints *before* the  line and remove any duplicates, followed by restarting the backend server.

Restart the backend to ensure the corrected Enhanced CMS API endpoints are active and accessible.
